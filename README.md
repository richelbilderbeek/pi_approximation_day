# Pi Approximation Day

Since 2012, I celebrate Pi Approximation Day by approximating pi 
with streetchalk.

 * What: Approximate pi with street chalk  (similar to [Pi Day](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/pi_day))
 * When: Pi Approximation Day (that is, July 22nd) from 7:22 AM, then approximately one hour
 * Where: [Uppsala Slott, Uppsala](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=uppsala%20slott#map=18/59.85363/17.63520),
   which is a 10 minutes walk from the central station (see map below)
 * To bring: a box of street chalk, knee protectors are recommended
 * Costs: a box of street chalk :-)

If rain is predicted, at 22:00 the day before, the event will be cancelled, 
which will be displayed in the status indicator here:

```
2023: yes
```

## 2022

I celebrated this time with BE and Ix. We did 200 digits.

## 2021

I celebrated it alone this year, for the first time in Uppsala, 
for 62 digits, which I did twice :+1:.

Took me only half an hour and a third of a bucket of streetchalk, 
as the concrete is smooth.

## 2020

I celebrated it alone this year, for 40 digits :+1:.

## 2019

We were with: 

 * J.D.  
 * S.D.
 * V.D
 * W.D

We approximated 447 digits of pi.

## 2018

We were with: 

 * B. S-B.
 * J.D.  
 * M.B.
 * P. S-B.
 * R. B.
 * R. G.

We approximated 500 digits of pi, breaking all earlier records!

## 2017

Since 2012, I celebrate Pi Approximation Day by approximating pi with streetchalk at the Noorderplantsoen Groningen. 
In 2017 we were with six: B. S-B., C.IJ., J.K, M. S-B., P. S-B and me. We reached 247 digits behind the comma.  

Our pi was filmed by the YouTube user Bhut_Trolokia, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBL1f0vJxJs">view the YouTube video here</a>.

Out pi got mentioned in a news article by <a href="https://www.sikkom.nl/video-vreemde-227-boodschap-noorderplantsoen/">sikkom</a>.
The text in the article, however, is complete nonsense.

Here are the photos, thanks to C.IJ.

## 2016

Since 2012, I celebrate Pi Approximation Day by approximating pi with streetchalk at the Noorderplantsoen Groningen. 
This year I was helped by C.IJ. and we reached approximately 150 (nice) - 200 (sloppy) digits behind the comma.

## 2015

Since 2012, I celebrate Pi Approximation Day by approximating pi with streetchalk at the Noorderplantsoen Groningen. 
This year I was helped by C.IJ. and we reached exactly 314 digits behind the comma.

exactly 100 digits behind the comma.

## 2013

Since 2012, I celebrate Pi Approximation Day by approximating pi with streetchalk at the Noorderplantsoen Groningen. 
In 2013, a local newspaper found out:

Thanks to the people that found out this article was written!

## 2012

2012 was the first your I celebrated Pi Approximation Day 
by approximating pi with streetchalk at the Noorderplantsoen Groningen.

## FAQ

### Why that time?

Due to this unorthodox hour, we can work relatively undisturbed. 
It is the KNMI time of sunrise, which means that there will be light to see. 

### How long does it take?

At the first of any of these conditions:

 * We've gone round the pond once
 * Out of street chalk
 * Not enjoying it anymore

With 5 people, it takes one and a half hour to get round the pond.

### How much street chalk do you need?

To go round the pond once, one needs approx five boxes of street chalk.

### How to listen to the digits of pi?

On Linux, install pi:

```
sudo apt-get install pi
```

then:

```
pi 2000 | espeak -s 10 -g 10
```

Or read out the text file:

```
cat pi.txt | espeak -s 10 -g 10
```
