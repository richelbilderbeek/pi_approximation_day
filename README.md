# Pi Approximation Day 2018

Since 2012, I celebrate Pi Approximation Day by approximating pi 
with streetchalk at the Noorderplantsoen Groningen.

 * What: Approximate pi with street chalk
 * When: 5:46 AM (yes, in the morning) at Pi Approximation Day (that is, Juli 22nd)
 * Where: Noorderplantsoen, Groningen, at the North side of the oval pond with sprinklers, 
   close to restaurant Zondag (see map below)
 * To bring: a box of street chalk, knee protectors are recommended
 * Costs: a box of street chalk :-)

If it is raining, at 4:00 AM, the event will be cancelled, 
which will be displayed in the status indicator here:

```
2019: Yes
```

## FAQ

### Why that time?

Due to this unorthodox hour, we can work relatively undisturbed. 
It is the KNMI time of sunrise, which means that there will be light to see. 

### How to listen to the digits of pi?

```
cat pi.txt | espeak -s 10 -g 10
```
